  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Under some circumstances, emacs and ctags can conflict. By default,
      emacs provides an executable `ctags` that would conflict with the
      executable of the same name that ctags provides. To prevent this,
      Homebrew removes the emacs `ctags` and its manpage before linking.
      However, if you install emacs with the `--keep-ctags` option, then
      the `ctags` emacs provides will not be removed. In that case, you
      won't be able to install ctags successfully. It will build but not
      link.
